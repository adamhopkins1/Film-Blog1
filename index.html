In the state ment the Association which consists of over 4000 memebers of major guilds of critics and experts said "The decision to hold the Critics Choice Awards in February as opposed to the prior date of January was a unaminous decision made between the various guilds and the California Dept of Health due to the Peaking of the Omicron variant and based on models and timeline of decline we have decided in our best interest to hold the cermony at a later date in February 2022, To ensure the most minimal exposure for our public audiences and nomimnees." Currently the awards cermony which is to be presented in LA at the Beverly Hills Hotel was supposed to be originally held on January 9th 2022 but was postponed due to the continuing outbreaks of the Covid-19 Omicron variant. The CW said in a statement also that this decision "Will work in both our nominees and attendees best interests in accordance with the rules and guidance of the Calfornia Dept of Health".</p>
